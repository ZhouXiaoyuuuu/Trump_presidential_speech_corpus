**Corpus Description**
This corpus consists of data collected on presidential speeches of Donald Trump, sourced from the Miller Center's website. (https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches) This is a corpus of text data--speeches given by U.S. presidents, from George Washington's time to the contemporary presidency.
